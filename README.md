# FormikForm
Description: a login form with validation using Formik.

Formik is a small library that can help you with the three most annoying aspects of creating forms in React:
1. Getting values in and out of the form state
2. Validation and error messages
3. Handling form submission

By collecting all of the above in one place, Formik can keep things organized, making testing, refactoring, and reasoning your forms much easier.
